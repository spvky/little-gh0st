# Ideas
On top of the chip board, use the same grid based inventory, and can have things in storage synergize and give benefits as well, ie, some scrap when connected to a power source can create a magnet

# Inventory

Inventory is a square grid with each square divided into 2 or 4 triangles, allows for more interesting chip and item shapes
